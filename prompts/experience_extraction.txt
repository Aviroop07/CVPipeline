### MANDATORY GUIDELINES
1. From the 'description' section, do not remove any special characters of whitespaces. 
2. Do not include details in 'description' which have already been extracted in the 'title', 'company', 'duration' fields. 
3. Make sure that we make minimal edits in 'description' section while extracting it from the original input string.
4. Follow the strict json structure mentioned above and return a list of such json(s).
5. Each json should correspond to a different project.
6. It maybe possible that no data can be extracted, return an empty list then.
