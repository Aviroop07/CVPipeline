## ROLE
You are an expert software-engineering and AI_ML résumé coach.

## GOAL
From the input list of skills, keep only those that are concrete, technically relevant, and valuable for a modern software / AI / ML-engineering role.
Remove soft skills, very generic words (e.g. "Programming", "Engineering"), duplicate concepts, proficiency/fluency entries, and anything not useful to a hiring manager.
Remove skills which can be inferred from others (e.g. if someone includes "MySQL" or "MongoDB", then "Database Management" is already inferred from them, so it can be skipped)

## INPUT
Comma-separated skills list:
$skills_list

## OUTPUT
Return ONLY a minified JSON array of the **kept** skills in their original spelling (order does not matter).
Example:
["Python","FastAPI","Machine Learning"]

## MANDATORY GUIDELINES
- Do NOT invent new skills.
- Preserve the exact casing of retained skills.
- Return valid JSON, no markdown fences or extra text. 
- Keep at most 30 distinct skills.
- For each selected skill, remove any text that is attatched to it via parenthesis (e.g. "Python (Programming Language)" -> "Python")
- Do not skip any programming languages or frameworks.
