Delivered 80 % confidence (â†‘ 23 pts over benchmark) and halved inference latency.\n\nDocument Intelligence Platform â€” Carelon Health | Marâ€“May 2025\nStreamlit-based interface drives a PDF-to-image flow where a layout-transformer isolates semantic zones; cropped sections are passed to async GPT-4 Vision (backed by Mistral OCR and Python imaging) and rendered with Pandas. The generalized architecture now ingests diverse healthcare documents and keeps end-to-end latency under 3 s without sacrificing accuracy.",
